# Human Offspring

Unlike our own offspring, who are born fully formed, Human offspring remain in the care of their parents for several Earth decades.

## Identifying Immature Humans

### The youngest humans (less than 10 human years)

These humans are not particularly useful to us, but can provide a valuable opportunity to initiate contact with the Human parent.

#### Identification

- smaller than mature humans
- usually found in the care of mature humans. 

**Important**

Do not confuse young humans with pets. Pets are Earth species that live with humans.

Although humans sometimes treat pets like offspring, they become extremely agitated if you confuse the two.


### The teenaged humans (10 to 20 years)

These are the most challenging humans you will encounter. It is best to keep contact to a minimum.

#### Identification

- generally travel in groups
- highly emotional (often laughing or crying)

**Caution**

In size, and physical maturity, teenagers are easily confused with adults.
