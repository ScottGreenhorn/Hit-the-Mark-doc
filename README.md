# Hit-the-Mark FAQ

### Why did we choose this idea?
While working on the Demand Sensing CPG project, we discovered that internal teams were having a hard time getting accurate and timely information about configuration. We determined that Confluence wasn't a great tool for delivering of controlling the configuration content. Our goal was to try to find a better way of creating and maintaining configuration content. That's when we started investigating using Markdown files and GitHub to create a better process.
